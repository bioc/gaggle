\title{Specify the Species To Which Subsequent Data Belongs}
\description{A gaggle broadcast always includes the species (the organism) the data is associated with.
             For example, the KEGG goose must tell the KEGG web server what organism the accomanying
             gene names are from.  The R Goose has a notion of \emph{default species}; this command
             is a convenient way to learn the current value of  that default.}
\usage{species = getSpecies ()}
\value{Returns the name of the current species.}
