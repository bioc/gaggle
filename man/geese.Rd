\title{What Geese (Programs) are Currently Running in the Gaggle?}
\description{Data can be broadcast to, or recevied from, any program currently running in the Gaggle.  
             You can broadcast to \code{boss} or to \code{all}, and let the current Boss settings
             determine which geese get the data.  Or you can use \code{setTargetGoose} to specify
             one particular goose -- this is the most common approach.  The current function supports
             that approach:  it returns the names of all currently running geese.}
\usage{nm <- geese ()}
\value{Returns the names of all currently running geese as a list of character strings.}
